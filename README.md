## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am Kamal Bisen, an enthusiast currently hacking on some of my projects.

I love to work with challanging problems, interpreters, compilers. I am proficient with [Java](https://www.java.com/en/),
[Mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/), [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/), JavaScript,
TypeScript and HTML/CSS amongst others. Currently hacking on react.

As you might have guessed, I love lesser known programming languages and
systems.
